Many databases exist in connection with COVID-19, but no virtual platform currently integrates a significant proportion of these sources. It then becomes difficult to make a global analysis, and to make connections between this often-medical information and external factors, notably socio-political. With this in mind, COVID-19 Data Hub aims to develop a unified dataset helpful for a better understanding of COVID-19.

In this tutorial we are going to build a simple yet complete Shiny application using the R Package COVID19: R Interface to COVID-19 Data Hub.

A basic understanding of Shiny (web apps) and plotly (interactive plots) is assumed, but it is possible to build a fully functioning app simply by copy/paste.
